       (credit_limit - outstanding) as available_credit
FROM customers;

-- Get customer count by city
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM customers GROUP BY city;
```

### Order Management
```sql
-- Get all pending orders
SELECT o.order_no, o.order_date, c.name, p.name, o.qty, o.status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.status = 'Pending';

-- Get orders by date range
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2026-06-01' AND '2026-06-30'
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

-- Get order value (qty * rate)
SELECT order_no, qty, rate, (qty * rate) as total_value
FROM orders;
```

### Trip & Vehicle Management
```sql
-- Get vehicle utilization
SELECT v.number, COUNT(t.id) as trip_count, SUM(t.revenue) as total_revenue
FROM vehicles v
LEFT JOIN trips t ON v.id = t.vehicle_id
GROUP BY v.id, v.number;

-- Get vehicle with expiring documents
SELECT number, insurance_expiry, fitness_expiry, permit_expiry
FROM vehicles
WHERE insurance_expiry < CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days'
   OR fitness_expiry < CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Get driver performance
SELECT d.name, COUNT(t.id) as trips, SUM(t.net_profit) as profit
FROM drivers d
LEFT JOIN trips t ON d.id = t.driver_id
GROUP BY d.id, d.name;
```

### Financial Reports
```sql
-- Sales by customer (monthly)
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', i.invoice_date) as month, 
       c.name, SUM(i.total_amount) as sales
FROM sales_invoices i
JOIN customers c ON i.customer_id = c.id
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', i.invoice_date), c.name;

-- GST calculation
SELECT SUM(cgst_amount) as cgst, SUM(sgst_amount) as sgst, SUM(igst_amount) as igst
FROM sales_invoices
WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month';

-- Invoice aging (AR/AP)
SELECT invoice_no, party, total_amount, 
       CURRENT_DATE - invoice_date as days_outstanding,
       CASE WHEN CURRENT_DATE - invoice_date > 30 THEN 'Overdue'
            WHEN CURRENT_DATE - invoice_date > 0 THEN 'Pending'
            ELSE 'Not Due' END as status

## 🎯 API Endpoints Quick Reference

### CRUD Pattern
```
GET    /api/customers              → List all
POST   /api/customers              → Create one
GET    /api/customers/:id          → Get one
PUT    /api/customers/:id          → Update one
DELETE /api/customers/:id          → Delete one
```

### Special Operations
```
PATCH  /api/orders/:id/status      → Update order status
GET    /api/orders?customerId=xxx  → Filter by customer
GET    /api/invoices/sales         → Get sales invoices
GET    /api/invoices/purchase      → Get purchase invoices
```

## 💾 Backup & Recovery

### Backup PostgreSQL
```bash
# Full backup
pg_dump honeyent_db > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Compressed backup
pg_dump honeyent_db | gzip > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz

# Backup specific table
pg_dump -t customers honeyent_db > customers-backup.sql
```

### Restore from Backup
```bash
# Restore full database

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` to git
   - Use `.env.example` template
   - Rotate JWT secrets regularly

2. **Database**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable SSL connections
   - Restrict network access
   - Regular backups (daily minimum)

3. **API**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add JWT authentication
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use HTTPS only in production

4. **Data**
   - Encrypt sensitive fields
   - Log all transactions
   - Implement audit trail
   - GDPR/Privacy compliance

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**Port 3000 already in use?**
```bash
# Windows: Find and kill process
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Database connection refused?**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL service
sudo service postgresql status

# Or on Mac
brew services list

# Test connection
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d honeyent_db
```

**CORS errors?**
- Verify FRONTEND_URL in backend `.env`
- Check frontend API_URL matches backend URL
- Ensure both are running on correct ports

**Migration issues?**
```bash
# List all tables
psql honeyent_db -c "\dt"

# Drop all tables and start fresh
psql honeyent_db -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
psql honeyent_db -f scripts/init-schema.sh
```
